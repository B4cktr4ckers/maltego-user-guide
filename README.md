## Introduction
Maltego is a powerful open-source intelligence (OSINT) and data visualization tool (It's a bit like a mental map that we do at school, but for OSINT). <br>
It helps cybersecurity professionals connect the dots by visualizing relationships between data points, such as IPs, domains, files, and even malware samples. <br>
Like mental maps, this system allows you to have a quick visual of all the data available. <br>
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to using Maltego for malware analysis, from basic setup to performing an investigation. <br>

## Why Maltego ?
To complete what was said above, and to summarize and give concrete examples. <br>
Maltego is the equivalent of the cork board with all the evidence from the old detective series <br>
(The famous cork board with red threads connecting all the evidence together) <br>
It is a visual way of collecting clues about a specific situation.
<br>
Some usage of Maltego is :
- Tracking Criminals: View connections between email addresses, phones, and online profiles to identify suspects or organized groups.
- Fraud analysis: Examine financial transfers, fake accounts or fictitious organizations.
- Cyberattack tracking: Identify where an attack is coming from by connecting digital clues (like IP addresses and servers).
- Investigative Research: Collect and organize information for investigative reporting (e.g. Pandora Papers).
- Finding information about individuals: Find email addresses, social media profiles, phone numbers, or associations with organizations. <br>

Some famous exemples :
- During investigations into malicious infrastructure linked to attacks like Emotet, Maltego has been used to map associated domains, servers and IP addresses, allowing the location of command and control (C&C) servers.
- Maltego has been included in investigations by Interpol and other agencies to detect terrorist organizations' financing networks or their online communications.
- Journalists investigating the misuse of Pegasus spyware (by governments to target journalists, activists, and politicians) used Maltego to visualize and understand the connections between targeted phone numbers and the organizations involved.
<br>
Maltego is also used by police force worldwide : <br>
- Interpol 🌍 <br>
- Cyber Police 🇺🇦 <br>
- Federal Bureau of Investigations 🇺🇸 <br>

## Why Use Maltego for Malware Analysis?
Maltego’s graph-based interface makes it ideal for:
- **Investigating malware infrastructure** (domains, IP addresses, email addresses).
- **Mapping relationships** between malware indicators (IOCs).
- **Connecting OSINT data** to malware samples for deeper analysis. <br>

## Setting Up Maltego

### Step 1: Install Maltego
1. Download Maltego from [Maltego's official website](https://www.maltego.com/).
2. Install the appropriate version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   
> [!TIP]
> For Linux users, I encourage you to search directly on the internet for "how to install maltego" accompanied by your distribution

### Step 2: Create an Account
1. Launch Maltego and sign up for a free license (community edition, the only one you can use at least u wana pay 8k).
2. Log in to the Maltego client (just follow the instructions).
3. You are ready to go !

## Key Features of Maltego for Malware Analysis

### 1. **Graph-Based Visualization**
   - Visualize relationships between malware indicators (IPs, domains, hashes).
   - Identify infrastructure shared by different malware families.

### 2. **OSINT Integration**
   - Leverage external services like VirusTotal, Shodan, and AbuseIPDB.

### 3. **Custom Entities**
   - Add custom indicators (e.g., file hashes or unique IOCs).

### 4. **Collaboration**
   - Share graphs with teammates for collaborative analysis.

---

## Practical Example: Analyzing a Malicious Domain

### Step 1: Add the Malicious Domain
1. Drag the "Domain" entity onto the graph.
2. Enter the suspected malicious domain (e.g., `example-malware.com`).

### Step 2: Expand the Investigation
- Explore connected entities (e.g., hosting IP, subdomains).
- Run transforms on new entities to identify additional IOCs.

### Step 3: Analyze Results 🕵️
- Look for patterns such as shared infrastructure or reused domains/IPs.
- Document findings for reporting or further investigation.

> [!WARNING]
> Of course, don't use these techniques for bad intentioned purposes. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> If you are lost I will summarize it all a little more simply. <br>
> Maltego generates a cork board for you <br>
> You will be able to put post it notes of different types (people, building, computer, etc.) <br>
> You can write details inside this note <br>
> And then by putting several together you can connect them with a red woolen thread (like in old detective films) <br>
> It is then up to you, using your evidence, to make your comparisons and deductions. <br>

## Tips and Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Begin with a single entity (e.g., a domain or IP) to avoid cluttered graphs.
2. **Use Filters**: Focus on significant connections by hiding unrelated entities.
3. **Validate Findings**: Cross-reference data with other tools (e.g., Threat Intelligence Platforms).
4. **Stay Up-to-Date**: Regularly update transforms and integrate new data sources.
