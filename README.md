## Introduction
Maltego is a powerful open-source intelligence (OSINT) and data visualization tool (It's a bit like a mental map that we do at school, but for OSINT). <br>
It helps cybersecurity professionals connect the dots by visualizing relationships between data points, such as IPs, domains, files, and even malware samples. <br>
Like mental maps, this system allows you to have a quick visual of all the data available. <br>
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to using Maltego for malware analysis, from basic setup to performing an investigation. <br>

## Why Use Maltego for Malware Analysis?
Maltegoâ€™s graph-based interface makes it ideal for:
- **Investigating malware infrastructure** (domains, IP addresses, email addresses).
- **Mapping relationships** between malware indicators (IOCs).
- **Connecting OSINT data** to malware samples for deeper analysis. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> If we summarize, we can have a white board, with all our information and our proofs, to see more clearly and have better reasoning. <br>
> Putting all the data in one place by organizing it can make us realize things and help us find new reasoning or new avenues of investigation. <br>

## Setting Up Maltego

### Step 1: Install Maltego
1. Download Maltego from [Maltego's official website](https://www.maltego.com/).
2. Install the appropriate version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   
> [!TIP]
> For Linux users, I encourage you to search directly on the internet for "how to install maltego" accompanied by your distribution

### Step 2: Create an Account
1. Launch Maltego and sign up for a free license (community edition).
2. Log in to the Maltego client.

### Step 3: Configure Transforms
1. Install the required transforms for malware analysis:
   - **VirusTotal** (requires an API key).
   - **Shodan** (for IP and domain scans).
   - **AbuseIPDB** (for malicious IP lookups).
   - **PassiveTotal** (for domain WHOIS and DNS information).

## Key Features of Maltego for Malware Analysis

### 1. **Graph-Based Visualization**
   - Visualize relationships between malware indicators (IPs, domains, hashes).
   - Identify infrastructure shared by different malware families.

### 2. **OSINT Integration**
   - Leverage external services like VirusTotal, Shodan, and AbuseIPDB.

### 3. **Custom Entities**
   - Add custom indicators (e.g., file hashes or unique IOCs).

### 4. **Collaboration**
   - Share graphs with teammates for collaborative analysis.

## Practical Example: Analyzing a Malicious Domain

### Step 1: Add the Malicious Domain
1. Drag the "Domain" entity onto the graph.
2. Enter the suspected malicious domain (e.g., `example-malware.com`).

### Step 2: Run Transforms
1. Right-click the domain entity and run the following transforms:
   - **Resolve to IP**: Maps the domain to its IP address.
   - **Passive DNS Lookup**: Retrieves historical DNS data.
   - **WHOIS Lookup**: Gets ownership details of the domain.
   - **Check Reputation** (VirusTotal/AbuseIPDB): Analyzes the domain's reputation.

### Step 3: Expand the Investigation
- Explore connected entities (e.g., hosting IP, subdomains).
- Run transforms on new entities to identify additional IOCs.

### Step 4: Analyze Results
- Look for patterns such as shared infrastructure or reused domains/IPs.
- Document findings for reporting or further investigation.

> [!WARNING]
> Of course, don't use these techniques for bad intentioned purposes. <br>


> [!NOTE]
> If you are lost I will summarize it all a little more simply. <br>
> Maltego generates a cork board for you <br>
> You will be able to put post it notes of different types (people, building, computer, etc.) <br>
> You can write details inside this note <br>
> And then by putting several together you can connect them with a red woolen thread (like in old detective films) <br>
> It is then up to you, using your evidence, to make your comparisons and deductions. <br>

## Tips and Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Begin with a single entity (e.g., a domain or IP) to avoid cluttered graphs.
2. **Use Filters**: Focus on significant connections by hiding unrelated entities.
3. **Validate Findings**: Cross-reference data with other tools (e.g., Threat Intelligence Platforms).
4. **Stay Up-to-Date**: Regularly update transforms and integrate new data sources.
